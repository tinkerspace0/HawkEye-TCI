This is a example code for Thermal Expert Linux SDK.
It shows how to connect device, display image, get temperature, etc.
It uses opencv to display image, so user needs to install opencv to
compile. (version 2.4.9 is used)

compile command is as follows.

g++ Main.cpp -I/usr/local/include/i3system -L/usr/local/lib
{-li3system_te_64 or -li3system_te_32} -I{opencv header path} -L{opencv so file path}
-lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lpthread

fill the options, and then compile it. (SDK default install paths are
used above. if user changed file path manually, set appropriate file paths.)
